Hello Everyone!

Phi@i is excited to invite you to the 2nd event of The Grand Canonical Ensemble - **Integration Bee**! Math is an integral part of physics. Come find out if you have what it takes to be IISERM's Grand Integrator!
<!--more-->

**Rules and Format** :

1. The format of the tournament is Single Elimination - i.e. 16 Integrators will be put in a bracket and will first compete in the "Newton" phase. The 8 winners of this round will compete in the "Leibniz" phase, and finally the semis and finals will happen in the "Feynman" phase.
  
2. All matches will be best of three integrals. The Integrators will be given 1min in the "Newton" phase, 2mins in the "Leibniz" phase and 3mins in the "Feynman" phase per integral.
  
3. For an answer to be considered it must be circled within the time limit for the bee masters to check. If an answer is circled before the timer expires, the timer will be paused and the answer will be verified. If the answer is incorrect the timer will be unpaused till it expires or another answer is circled.
  
4. If neither Integrator manages to solve a particular integral, extra time or hints shall be given at the discretion of the bee masters.
  
5. Rules are subject to change based on the turnout, and changes will be announced at the time of the event if any.
  
6. On-the-spot registrations will be taken only if there is an absence, so please fill the form if you would like to participate.
  
***Prizes worth Rs. 800!!!***
