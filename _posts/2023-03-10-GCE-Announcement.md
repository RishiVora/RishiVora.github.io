**Hey everyone!**

_Are you tired of the mundane reality that surrounds us? Do you yearn for something more?_

Look no further than _**The Grand Canonical Ensemble**_!

Join us from _13th March to 19th March_ as we bring to you a multitude of exciting events!
Here’s a sneak peek of what we have in store for you:

## Pictionary: 
  
_Where your only hope of communicating physics concepts and phenomena is through squiggles on a blackboard._

## Integration Bee: 

_Test your calculus skills as you try to solve integrals as fast as possible._

## Physics quiz

_A trivia night all about mishaps, oddities, and all the weird stuff in the world of physics._

## What if?

_Solve wacky physics scenarios in a way you’ve never approached physics before_.

## Gedanken Experiment 

_Physics beyond your wildest thoughts. Wield your superpowers and veer around your handicaps to come up with weird theories and defend them._


And that's not all! We'll also be hosting a _talk_, a _hackathon_ and a _scifi movie night_ as well.
