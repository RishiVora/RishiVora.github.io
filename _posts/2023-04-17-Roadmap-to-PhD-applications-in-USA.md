Phi@I is excited to host a PhD application guide by the graduating batch!

<!--more-->
At this point, many ms19s and ms20s would be considering applying for PhDs in the United States. PhD applications can seem daunting. For many of us ms18s, advice from seniors helped us to successfully get through this process and we want to offer the same guidance to you all.

The 4 of us will be talking about this are
Aalhad (Complex Systems Physics and Theoretical Biology)
Amlan (Quantitative Ecology)
Pravita (Computational Astrophysics)
Smriti (Soft Matter and Biophysics)

While we are all physics majors, there are many similarities between applications across different subjects. We have also applied to interdisciplinary programs. Therefore, this type of session will be helpful to all.
