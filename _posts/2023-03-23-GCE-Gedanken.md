It's the year 2070, two years past the last scientific crisis. The Gedanken committee had not completely thought through their previous resolution, and thus we have upon us yet another major obstacle for the scientific world.<!--more-->

The great scientists must be resurrected again, as we have failed to better our mental capacities since the Experiment of 59'. Resurrection techniques have been enhanced, but they're not foolproof yet. But the desperation to resolve the crisis has led to the resurrection of the scientists, which, as a consequence, have a superpower and a handicap.

As a scientist who has been recently resurrected, you will have to talk your way through others, explaining why your theories on how to solve the crisis have the most potential to explain and resolve the problem at hand. In addition to this, you also have to keep in mind your country while proposing your solutions, much like a mock UN debate. Also, your powers and handicaps will come in extremely handy in deciding the final resolution of the committee.

The details of the event are as follows - <br>
**Date**: 25th and 26th March <br>
**Time**: 10:00 am - 5:00 pm with a lunch break <br>
**Venue**: LH4 <br>

Hosted by LDS and Phi@i teams

<strong> Coming soon: </strong> List of scientists, their superpowers, resolutions, final paper published.
